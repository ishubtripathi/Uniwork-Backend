# UniWork Backend

UniWork is a platform that allows users to upload their work in formats such as PNG, JPEG, PDF, and GIF. The work is stored in a decentralized system using IPFS, and each uploaded file is minted as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can search their work by NFT token ID, and the platform displays owner details and other profile information.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload PNG, JPEG, PDF, and GIF files.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored using IPFS for decentralized and secure storage.
- **NFT Generation**: Each uploaded file is minted as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-721 standard.
- **Search by Token ID**: Users can search their work using the unique NFT token ID.
- **Owner Profile**: Display owner information and file details.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express**: Backend server and API routes.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user profiles and file metadata.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: NFT minting and management using Web3.js.
- **Multer**: For handling file uploads in Express.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables securely.
